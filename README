Change Detection Using Magnetic Field Data
------------------------------------------

Use Case: Using Mobile Phone Magnetic Field data to identify change in location of the device.
Assumption: Significant change in the magnetic field when device move from one location to another.
Required: Figuring out methodology to identify change in distance. Distributing change magnitude in levels.
